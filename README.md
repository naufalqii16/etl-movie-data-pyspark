# 🎬 PySpark Movie Data ETL Pipeline

A simple ETL pipeline using **PySpark** to read data from **CSV and PostgreSQL**, perform transformations, and write the final results back into a database. This project serves as a practical exploration of large-scale ETL processes using Apache Spark and relational databases.

## 📌 Project Objectives

To explore a basic **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process with PySpark, including:

- Reading **movie ratings** data from a CSV file
- Reading movie metadata from **PostgreSQL**
- Performing **joins**, **cleansing**, **casting**, and **filtering**
- Saving the final output back to PostgreSQL
